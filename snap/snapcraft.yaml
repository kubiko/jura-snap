description: |
   Until recently, machine-to-machine projects have been approached as embedded systems
   designed around custom hardware, custom software, and custom network connectivity.
   The challenge of developing such projects was given by the large customization
   and integration costs and the small re-usability across similar engagements.
   The results were often proprietary systems leveraging proprietary protocols.
